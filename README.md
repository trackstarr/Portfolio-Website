## Getting Started

To use this portfolio template, simply clone the repository and modify the HTML and CSS files to suit your needs. Replace the placeholder content, such as your photo and project images, with your own information.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trackstarr/Portfolio-Website.git
```

## Sections

### About Me

The "About Me" section provides a brief introduction to yourself. You can customize the text and the photo in the HTML file. Update the image source to point to your recent photo.

### My Work

The "My Work" section is designed to showcase your projects. The current template includes a grid layout for project images. Add more projects by duplicating the existing `<a>` element and updating the `href` and `img` tags.

### Contact Me

The "Contact Me" section includes a simple form for visitors to reach out to you. Update the `action` attribute in the form tag to point to your form submission script.

## Styling

The CSS file (`styles.css`) contains styling rules for the website. You can modify these styles to match your preferences. The current styles provide a clean and responsive layout.

Feel free to make this template your own by customizing the content and styles to reflect your personal brand.
